# 5. Call this.setState from Another Function
The most common way to call `this.setState()` is to call a custom function that wraps a `this.setState()` call. `.makeSomeFog()` is an example:

``` javascript
class Example extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { weather: 'sunny' };
    this.makeSomeFog = this.makeSomeFog.bind(this);
  }

  makeSomeFog() {
    this.setState({
      weather: 'foggy'
    });
  }
}
```

Notice how the method `makeSomeFog()` contains a call to `this.setState()`.

You may have noticed a weird line in there:

``` javascript
this.makeSomeFog = this.makeSomeFog.bind(this);
```

This line is necessary because `makeSomeFog()`’s body contains the word this. We'll talk about it more soon!

Let's walk through how a function wrapping `this.setState()` might work in practice. In the code editor, read **Mood.js** all the way through.

### Mood.js

``` javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

class Mood extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { mood: 'good' };
    this.toggleMood = this.toggleMood.bind(this);
  }

  toggleMood() {
    const newMood = this.state.mood == 'good' ? 'bad' : 'good';
    this.setState({ mood: newMood });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>I'm feeling {this.state.mood}!</h1>
        <button onClick={this.toggleMood}>
          Click Me
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<Mood />, document.getElementById('app'));
```

Here is how a `<Mood />`’s state would be set:

1. A user triggers an event (in this case a click event, triggered by clicking on a `<button></button>`).

2. The event from Step 1 is being listened for (in this case by the `onClick` attribute).

3. When this listened-for event occurs, it calls an event handler function (in this case, `this.toggleMood()`).

4. Inside of the body of the event handler, `this.setState()` is called.

5. The component's state is changed!

Due to the way that event handlers are bound in JavaScript, `this.toggleMood()` loses its this when it is used. Therefore, the expressions `this.state.mood` and `this.setState` won't mean what they're supposed to... unless you have already bound the correct this to `this.toggleMood`.

That is why we must bind `this.toggleMood`.

For an in-depth explanation of this kind of binding trickery, begin with the React docs. For the less curious, just know that in React, whenever you define an event handler that uses this, you need to add `this.methodName = this.methodName.bind(this)` to your constructor function.

Look at the statement `const newMood = this.state.mood == 'good' ? 'bad' : 'good';`. 
What does that do?

This line declares a const named newMood equal to the opposite of `this.state.mood`. If `this.state.mood` is "good", then newMood will be "bad," and vice versa.

A `<Mood />` instance would display "I'm feeling good!" along with a button. Clicking on the button would change the display to "I'm feeling bad!" Clicking again would change back to "I'm feeling good!," etc. Try to follow the step-by-step walkthrough in `Mood.js` and see how all of this works.

**One final note:** you can't call `this.setState()` from inside of the render function! We'll explain why in the next exercise.

## Task:

``` javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';


const green = '#39D1B4';
const yellow = '#FFD712';

class Toggle extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      color: green
    };
    this.changeColor = this.changeColor.bind(this);
  }
  
  changeColor() {
    const newColor = this.state.color == green ? yellow : green;
    this.setState({ color: newColor})
  }
  
  render() {
    return (
      <div style = {{background: this.state.color}}>
        <h1>
          Change my color
        </h1>
        <button onClick = {this.changeColor}>
        	Change color
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}


ReactDOM.render(
	<Toggle />,
  document.getElementById('app')
);
```
