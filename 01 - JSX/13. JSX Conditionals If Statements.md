# 13. JSX Conditionals: If Statements
## If Statements That Don't Work
Great work! You've learned how to use curly braces to inject JavaScript into a JSX expression!

Here's a rule that you need to know: you can not inject an if statement into a JSX expression.

This code will break:

``` javascript
(
  <h1>
    {
      if (purchase.complete) {
        'Thank you for placing an order!'
      }
    }
  </h1>
)
```

The reason why has to do with the way that JSX is compiled. You don't need to understand the mechanics of it for now, but if you're interested then you can learn more here.

What if you want a JSX expression to render, but only under certain circumstances? You can't inject an if statement. What can you do?

You have lots of options. In the next few lessons, we'll explore some simple ways to write conditionals (expressions that are only executed under certain conditions) in JSX.

## If Statements That Do Work
How can you write a conditional, if you can't inject an if statement into JSX?

Well, one option is to write an `if` statement, and not inject it into JSX.

Look at if.js. Follow the `if` statement, all the way from line 6 down to line 18.

if.js works, because the words `if` and else are not injected in between JSX tags. The `if` statement is on the outside, and no JavaScript injection is necessary.

This is a common way to express conditionals in JSX.

### Task:

``` javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

let message;

if (user.age >= drinkingAge) {
  message = (
    <h1>
      Hey, check out this alcoholic beverage!
    </h1>
  );
} else {
  message = (
    <h1>
      Hey, check out these earrings I got at Claire's!
    </h1>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(
  message, 
  document.getElementById('app')
);
```

## The Ternary Operator
There's a more compact way to write conditionals in JSX: the ternary operator.

The ternary operator works the same way in React as it does in regular JavaScript. However, it shows up in React surprisingly often.

Recall how it works: you write `x ? y : z`, where x, y, and z are all JavaScript expressions. When your code is executed, `x` is evaluated as either "truthy" or "falsy." If `x` is truthy, then the entire ternary operator returns `y`. If `x` is falsy, then the entire ternary operator returns `z`. Here's a nice explanation if you need a refresher.

Here's how you might use the ternary operator in a JSX expression:

``` javascript
const headline = (
  <h1>
    { age >= drinkingAge ? 'Buy Drink' : 'Do Teen Stuff' }
  </h1>
);
```

In the above example, if `age` is greater than or equal to `drinkingAge`, then headline will equal `<h1>`Buy Drink`</h1>`. Otherwise, headline will equal `<h1>`Do Teen Stuff`</h1>`.

### Task:

``` javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

function coinToss () {
  // Randomly return either 'heads' or 'tails'.
  return Math.random() < 0.5 ? 'heads' : 'tails';
}

const pics = {
  kitty: 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/React/react_photo-kitty.jpg',
  doggy: 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/React/react_photo-puppy.jpeg'
};

const img = <img src={pics[coinToss() === 'heads' ? 'kitty' : 'doggy']} />;

ReactDOM.render(
	img, 
	document.getElementById('app')
);
```
