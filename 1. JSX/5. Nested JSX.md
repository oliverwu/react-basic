# 5. Nested JSX
You can nest JSX elements inside of other JSX elements, just like in HTML.

Here's an example of a JSX `<h1>` element, nested inside of a JSX `<a>` element:

``` html
<a href="https://www.example.com"><h1>Click me!</h1></a>
```

To make this more readable, you can use HTML-style line breaks and indentation:

``` html
<a href="https://www.example.com">
  <h1>
    Click me!
  </h1>
</a>
```

If a JSX expression takes up more than one line, then you must wrap the multi-line JSX expression in parentheses. This looks strange at first, but you get used to it:

``` javascript
(
  <a href="https://www.example.com">
    <h1>
      Click me!
    </h1>
  </a>
)
```

Nested JSX expressions can be saved as variables, passed to functions, etc., just like non-nested JSX expressions can! Here's an example of a nested JSX expression being saved as a variable:

``` javascript
const theExample = (
   <a href="https://www.example.com">
     <h1>
       Click me!
     </h1>
   </a>
 );
```

## JSX Outer Elements
There's a rule that we haven't mentioned: a JSX expression must have exactly one outermost element.

In other words, this code will work:

``` javascript
const paragraphs = (
  <div id="i-am-the-outermost-element">
    <p>I am a paragraph.</p>
    <p>I, too, am a paragraph.</p>
  </div>
);
```

But this code will not work:

``` javascript
const paragraphs = (
  <p>I am a paragraph.</p> 
  <p>I, too, am a paragraph.</p>
);
```

The first opening tag and the final closing tag of a JSX expression must belong to the same JSX element!

It's easy to forget about this rule, and end up with errors that are tough to diagnose.

If you notice that a JSX expression has multiple outer elements, the solution is usually simple: wrap the JSX expression in a `<div></div>`.
