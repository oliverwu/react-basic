# 11. Curly Braces in JSX
``` javascript
ReactDOM.render(
  <h1>2 + 3</h1>,
  document.getElementById('app')
);
```

The code in the last exercise didn't behave as one might expect. Instead of adding 2 and 3, it printed out ”2 + 3” as a string of text. Why?

This happened because `2 + 3` is located in between `<h1>` and `</h1>` tags.

Any code in between the tags of a JSX element will be read as JSX, not as regular JavaScript! JSX doesn't add numbers - it reads them as text, just like HTML.

You need a way to write code that says, "Even though I am located in between JSX tags, treat me like ordinary JavaScript and not like JSX."

You can do this by wrapping your code in curly braces.

## 20 Digits of Pi in JSX
You can now inject regular JavaScript into JSX expressions! This will be extremely useful.

In the code editor, you can see a JSX expression that displays the first twenty digits of pi.

Study the expression and notice the following:

* The code is written in a JavaScript file. By default, it will all be treated as regular JavaScript.
* Find `<div>` on line 5. From there up through `</div>`, the code will be treated as JSX.
* Find `Math`. From there up through `(20)`, the code will be treated as regular JavaScript again.
* The curly braces themselves won't be treated as JSX nor as JavaScript. They are markers that signal the beginning and end of a JavaScript injection into JSX, similar to the quotation marks that signal the boundaries of a string.

## Variables in JSX
When you inject JavaScript into JSX, that JavaScript is part of the same environment as the rest of the JavaScript in your file.

That means that you can access variables while inside of a JSX expression, even if those variables were declared on the outside.

``` javascript
// Declare a variable:
const name = 'Gerdo';

// Access your variable 
// from inside of a JSX expression:
const greeting = <p>Hello, {name}!</p>;
```

## Variable Attributes in JSX
When writing JSX, it's common to use variables to set attributes.

Here's an example of how that might work:

``` javascript
// Use a variable to set the `height` and `width` attributes:

const sideLength = "200px";

const panda = (
  <img 
    src="images/panda.jpg" 
    alt="panda" 
    height={sideLength} 
    width={sideLength} />
);
```

Notice how in this example, the `<img />`’s attributes each get their own line. This can make your code more readable if you have a lot of attributes on one element.

Object properties are also often used to set attributes:

``` javascript
const pics = {
  panda: "http://bit.ly/1Tqltv5",
  owl: "http://bit.ly/1XGtkM3",
  owlCat: "http://bit.ly/1Upbczi"
}; 

const panda = (
  <img 
    src={pics.panda} 
    alt="Lazy Panda" />
);

const owl = (
  <img 
    src={pics.owl} 
    alt="Unimpressed Owl" />
);

const owlCat = (
  <img 
    src={pics.owlCat} 
    alt="Ghastly Abomination" />
);
```
