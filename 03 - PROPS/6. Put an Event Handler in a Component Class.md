# 6. Put an Event Handler in a Component Class
You can, and often will, pass functions as `props`. It is especially common to pass event handler functions.

You define an event handler as a method on the component class, just like the render method. Almost all functions that you define in React will be defined in this way, as methods in a class.

## Task:

``` javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Button } from './Button';


class Talker extends React.Component {
  talk() {
    let speech = '';
  	for (let i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
    	speech += 'blah ';
  	}
  	alert(speech); 
  }
  
  render() {
    return <Button />;
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <Talker />,
  document.getElementById('app')
);
```
