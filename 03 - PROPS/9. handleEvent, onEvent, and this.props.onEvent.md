# 9. handleEvent, onEvent, and this.props.onEvent
Let's talk about naming things.

When you pass an event handler as a prop, as you just did, there are two names that you have to choose.

Both naming choices occur in the parent component class - that is, in the component class that defines the event handler and passes it.

The first name that you have to choose is the name of the event handler itself.

## Example:
### Talker.js:

``` javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Button } from './Button';

class Talker extends React.Component {
  talk() {
    let speech = '';
    for (let i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
      speech += 'blah ';
    }
    alert(speech);
  }
  
  render() {
    return <Button talk={this.talk}/>;
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <Talker />,
  document.getElementById('app')
);
```

Look at Talker.js, lines 6 through 12. This is our event handler. We chose to name it `talk`.

The second name that you have to choose is the name of the prop that you will use to pass the event handler. This is the same thing as your attribute name.

For our prop name, we also chose `talk`, as shown on line 15:

`return <Button talk={this.talk} />;`

These two names can be whatever you want. However, there is a naming convention that they often follow. You don't have to follow this convention, but you should understand it when you see it.

Here's how the naming convention works: first, think about what type of event you are listening for. In our example, the event type was "click."

If you are listening for a "click" event, then you name your event handler `handleClick`. If you are listening for a "keyPress" event, then you name your event handler `handleKeyPress`:

``` javascript
class MyClass extends React.Component {
  handleHover() {
    alert('I am an event handler.');
    alert('I will be called in response to "hover" events.');
  }
}
```

Your prop name should be the word `on`, plus your event type. If you are listening for a "click" event, then you name your prop `onClick`. If you are listening for a "keyPress" event, then you name your prop `onKeyPress`:

``` javascript
class MyClass extends React.Component {
  handleHover() {
    alert('I am an event handler.');
    alert('I will listen for a "hover" event.');
  }

  render() {
    return <Child onHover={this.handleHover} />;
  }
}
```

## Task:
### Talk.js:

``` javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Button } from './Button';

class Talker extends React.Component {
  handleClick() {
    let speech = '';
    for (let i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
      speech += 'blah ';
    }
    alert(speech);
  }
  
  render() {
    return <Button onClick = {this.handleClick} />;
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <Talker />,
  document.getElementById('app')
);
```

### Button.js:

``` java
import React from 'react';

export class Button extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <button onClick = {this.props.onClick}>
        Click me!
      </button>
    );
  }
}
```

One major source of confusion is the fact that names like `onClick` have special meaning, but only if they're used on HTML-like elements.

Look at Button.js. When you give a `<button></button>` an attribute named `onClick`, then the name `onClick` has special meaning. As you've learned, this special `onClick` attribute creates an event listener, listening for clicks on the `<button></button>`:

``` javascript
// Button.js

// The attribute name onClick
// creates an event listner:
<button onClick={this.props.onClick}>
  Click me!
</button>
```

Now look at **Talker.js**. Here, when you give `<Button />` an attribute named `onClick`, then the name `onClick` doesn't do anything special. The name `onClick` does not create an event listener when used on `<Button />` - it's just an arbitrary attribute name:

``` javascript
// Talker.js

// The attribute name onClick
// is just a normal attribute name:
<Button onClick={this.handleClick} />

```

The reason for this is that in `<Button />` is not an HTML-like JSX element; it's a component instance.

Names like `onClick` only create event listeners if they're used on HTML-like JSX elements. Otherwise, they're just ordinary prop names.
