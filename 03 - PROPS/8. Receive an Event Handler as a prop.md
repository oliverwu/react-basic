# 8. Receive an Event Handler as a prop
Great! You just passed a function from `<Talker />` to `<Button />`.

In the code editor, select `Button.js`. Notice that Button renders a `<button></button>` element.

If a user clicks on this `<button></button>` element, then you want your passed-in `talk` function to get called.

That means that you need to attach `talk` to the `<button></button>` as an event handler.

How do you do that? The same way that you attach any event handler to a JSX element: you give that JSX element a special attribute. The attribute's name should be something like onClick or onHover. The attribute's value should be the event handler that you want to attach.

``` javascript
import React from 'react';

export class Button extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <button onClick = {this.props.talk}>
        Click me!
      </button>
    );
  }
}
```
