# 2. The BrowserRouter Component
## Install React Router
To use React Router in our app, we need to install react-router-dom.

`npm install --save react-router-dom`

What's nice about React Router is that everything is just a component. This makes using it nice, but it also makes diving into the code more convenient as well. Let's take a look at what exactly BrowserRouter is doing under the hood.

Here is the code straight from the React Router repository.

``` javascript
class BrowserRouter extends React.Component {
  static propTypes = {
    basename: PropTypes.string,
    forceRefresh: PropTypes.bool,
    getUserConfirmation: PropTypes.func,
    keyLength: PropTypes.number,
    children: PropTypes.node
  }

  history = createHistory(this.props)

  render() {
    return <Router history={this.history} children={this.props.children}  />
  }
}
```

When you use BrowserRouter, what you're really doing is rendering a Router component and passing it a history prop. Wait, what is history? history comes from the history library (also built by React Training). The whole purpose of this library is it abstracts away the differences in various environments and provides a minimal API that lets you manage the history stack, navigate, confirm navigation, and persist state between sessions.

So in a nutshell, when you use BrowserRouter, you're creating a history object which will listen to changes in the URL and make sure your app is made aware of those changes.

Step1: `import { BrowserRouter} from 'react-router-dom';`
Step2: `<BrowserRouter><App /></BrowserRouter>`

``` javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { BrowserRouter} from 'react-router-dom';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
import registerServiceWorker from './registerServiceWorker';

ReactDOM.render(
    <BrowserRouter><App /></BrowserRouter>,
    document.getElementById('root')
);
registerServiceWorker();
```
