# 1. Short-circuit Evaluation Syntax
In this video and when we created the "Now showing" from earlier section, we used a somewhat odd looking syntax:

``` javascript
{this.state.screen === 'list' && (
  <ListContacts
    contacts={this.state.contacts}
    onDeleteContact={this.removeContact}
  />
)}
```

and

``` javascript
{this.state.screen === 'create' && (
  <CreateContact />
)}
```

This can be a little confusing with both the JSX code for a component and the code to run an expression. But this is really just the logical expression `&&`:

`expression && expression`

What we're using here is a JavaScript technique called short-circuit evaluation. If the first expression evaluates to `true`, then the second expression is run. However, if the first expression evaluates to `false`, then the second expression is skipped. We're using this as a guard to first verify the value of `this.state.screen` before displaying the correct component.
