# 13. componentWillUnmount
A component's unmounting period occurs when the component is removed from the DOM. This could happen if the DOM is rerendered without the component, or if the user navigates to a different website or closes their web browser.

`componentWillUnmount` is the only unmounting lifecycle method!

`componentWillUnmount` gets called right before a component is removed from the DOM. If a component initiates any methods that require cleanup, then `componentWillUnmount` is where you should put that cleanup.

You can see an example in Example.js, as usual.

### Example.js

``` javascript
import React from 'react';

export class Example extends React.Component {
  componentWillUnmount() {
    alert('Goodbye world');
  }

  render() {
    return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
  }
}
```
