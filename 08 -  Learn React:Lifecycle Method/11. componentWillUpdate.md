# 11. componentWillUpdate
The third updating lifecycle method is `componentWillUpdate`.

`componentWillUpdate` gets called in between `shouldComponentUpdate` and `render`.

`componentWillUpdate` receives two arguments: `nextProps` and `nextState`. Read `Example` to see it in action.

### Example.js

``` javascript
import React from 'react';

export class Example extends React.Component {
  componentWillUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
    alert('Component is about to update!  Any second now!');
  }

  render() {
    return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
  }
}
```

You cannot call this.setState from the body of `componentWillUpdate`! Which begs the question, why would you use it?

The main purpose of `componentWillUpdate` is to interact with things outside of the React architecture. If you need to do non-React setup before a component renders, such as checking the `window` size or interacting with an `API`, then componentWillUpdate is a good place to do that.

If that sounds abstract, that's okay! All of the lifecycle methods might feel a bit theoretical, until you've used them in real-life scenarios. You'll be doing more of that in the next course.
