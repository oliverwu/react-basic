# 12. componentDidUpdate
The last updating lifecycle method is `componentDidUpdate`.

When a component instance updates, `componentDidUpdate` gets called after any rendered HTML has finished loading.

### Example.js

``` javascript
import React from 'react';

export class Example extends React.component {
  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
    alert('Component is done rendering!');
  }

  render() {
    return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
  }
}
```

Look at Example for an an example of `componentDidUpdate`.

`componentDidUpdate` automatically gets passed two arguments: `prevProps` and `prevState`. prevProps and prevState are references to the component's `props` and `state` before the current updating period began. You can compare them to the current `props` and `state`.

componentDidUpdate is usually used for interacting with things outside of the React environment, like the `browser` or `APIs`. It's similar to componentWillUpdate in that way, except that it gets called after render instead of before.
