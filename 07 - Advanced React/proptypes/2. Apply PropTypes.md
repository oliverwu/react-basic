# 2. Apply PropTypes
### MessageDisplay.js

``` javascript
import React from 'react';

export class MessageDisplayer extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>{this.props.message}</h1>;
  }
}

// This propTypes object should have
// one property for each expected prop:
MessageDisplayer.propTypes = {
  message: React.PropTypes.string
};
```

Notice the expression `this.props.message`. From this expression, you can deduce that `MessageDisplayer` expects to get passed a `prop` named `message`. Somewhere, at some time, this code is expected to execute:

`<MessageDisplayer message="something" />`

If a component class expects a `prop`, then you can give that component class a `propType`!

The first step to making a `propType` is to search for a `property` named `propTypes` on the instructions object. If there isn't one, make one! You will have to declare it after the close of your component declaration, since this it will be a static property.

See the example of a `propTypes` property on the MessageDisplay.js. Notice that the value of `propTypes` is an **object**, not a function!

The second step is to add a property to the `propTypes` object. For each `prop` that your component class expects to receive, there can be one property on your `propTypes` object.

`MessageDisplayer` only expects one `prop`: `message`. Therefore, its `propTypes` object only has one property.
