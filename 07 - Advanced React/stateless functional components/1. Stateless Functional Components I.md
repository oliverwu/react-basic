# 1. Stateless Functional Components I
When you separate a container component from a presentational component, the presentational component will always end up like this: one `render()` function, and no other properties.

If you have a component class with nothing but a render function, then you can rewrite that component class in a very different way. Instead of using `React.Component`, you can write it as JavaScript function!

A component class written as a function is called a stateless functional component. Stateless functional components have some advantages over typical component classes. We'll cover those advantages in this lesson.

### Example.js

``` javascript
// A component class written in the usual way:
export class MyComponentClass extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
  }
}

// The same component class, written as a stateless functional component:
export const MyComponentClass = () => {
  return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
}

// Works the same either way:
ReactDOM.render(
	<MyComponentClass />,
	document.getElementById('app')
);
```
