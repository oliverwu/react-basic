# 2. Don't Update props
Great work! You just passed information from a stateful component to a stateless component. You will be doing a lot of that.

You learned earlier that a component can change its state by calling `this.setState()`. You may have been wondering: how does a component change its props?

The answer: it doesn't!

### Bad.js

``` javascript
import React from 'react';

class Bad extends React.Component {
  render() {
    this.props.message = 'yo'; // NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
    return <h1>{this.props.message}</h1>;
  }
}
```

A component should never update `this.props`. Look at `Bad.js` to see an example of what not to do.

This is potentially confusing. `props` and `state` store dynamic information. Dynamic information can change, by definition. If a component can't change its `props`, then what are `props` for?

A React component should use `props` to store information that can be changed, but can only be changed by a different component.

A React component should use `state` to store information that the component itself can change.
