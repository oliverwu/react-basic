# 11. JSON
JSON is written in string key value pairs.  It needs the quotes.  That is why when we receive a request we use json parse to remove those strings from the keys.

if you are doing a fetch request with a headers object, the keys will be strings (in quotes)ã€‚

``` javascript
fetch(endpoint).then(response => {
    if (response.ok) {
      return response.json();
    }
    throw new Error('Request failed!');
  }, networkError => {
    console.log(networkError.message);
  }).then();
```

When you make a request, the data response is going to contain a Header and a Body. `.json()` will take Response Body and format the incoming stream which is just a stream of data bytes to something that is human readable, JSON. The Content-Type which is also include in the Request Body will tell you what kind of data is coming in. Usually this will be application/json.
