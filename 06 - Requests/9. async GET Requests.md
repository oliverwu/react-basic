# 9. async GET Requests
Here are some key points to keep in mind as we walk through the code:

* Using an `async` function that will return a promise.
* `await` can only be used in an `async` function. `await` allows a program to run while waiting for a promise to resolve.
* In a `try...catch` statement, code in the `try` block will be run and in the event of an exception/error, the code in the `catch` statement will run.

## Important!
fetch calls the endpoint url and returns a response, it is like an iou, so await takes that iou, and it lets the rest of the code to run, once the real response from the fetch comes back, await assigns it to response, so everything that uses response now will be filled with the right value.

it only pairs up with async on functions that will be working with promises. and it is declared before any promise, like in the case of fetch 

``` javascript
//The async keyword will ensure that the function returns a promise.
const getData = async () => {
  //The code in the try block will send a request and handle the response. The catch statement will then take care of an error if it is thrown.
  try {
    //Weâ€™ll have to save the returned promise in a variable called response using the const keyword. response will save the the response of endpoint once that information has been sent back.
    const response = await fetch('https://api-to-call.com/endpoint')
    if (response.ok) {
      const jsonResponse = await response.json();
      //Since .json() is an asynchronous method we have to await until the promise status is resolved. Then we store the value to know what data the JSON holds.
      return jsonResponse;
    }
    throw new Error('Request failed!');
  } catch(error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
};
```

``` javascript
// Information to reach API
const url = 'https://api.datamuse.com/words?';
const queryParams = 'rel_jja=';

// Selecting page elements
const inputField = document.querySelector('#input');
const submit = document.querySelector('#submit');
const responseField = document.querySelector('#responseField');

// AJAX function
// Code goes here
const getSuggestions = async () => {
  const wordQuery = inputField.value;
  const endpoint = `${url}${queryParams}${wordQuery}`;
  
  try {
    const response = await fetch(endpoint);
  	if (response.ok) {
    	const jsonResponse = await response.json();
      renderResponse(jsonResponse);
  	}
  } catch(error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
  
};

// Clear previous results and display results to webpage
const displaySuggestions = (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  while(responseField.firstChild){
    responseField.removeChild(responseField.firstChild)
  }
  getSuggestions();
}

submit.addEventListener('click', displaySuggestions);

```
