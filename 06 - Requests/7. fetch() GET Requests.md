# 7. fetch() GET Requests
The fetch() function:

* Creates a request object that contains relevant information that an API needs.
* Sends that request object to the API endpoint provided.
* Returns a promise that ultimately resolves to a response object, which contains the status of the promise with information the API sent back.

``` javascript
//This first argument determines the endpoint of the request.
fetch('https://api-to-call.com/endpoint').then(response => {

  //Chain a .then() method to the end of the fetch() function and pass it the success callback arrow function as its first argument. The success callback function takes one parameter, response.
  //.then() will fire only after the promise status of fetch() has been resolved.

	//The reason we are testing the ok property of the response object is that it will be a Boolean value. If there were no errors response.ok will be true  
  if (response.ok) {
    return response.json();
  }

  //Your code will throw this error when response.ok is falsy.
	throw new Error('Request failed!');
}, networkError => {
  //This second callback function will handle our failures.
  //If we could not reach the endpoint at all, e.g., the server is down, then we would get this networkError.
  console.log(networkError.message);
}).then(jsonResponse => {
  return jsonResponse;
});
//The second .then()'s success callback won’t run until the previous .then() method has finished running. It will also not run if there was an error was thrown previously.
```

### main.js

``` javascript
// Information to reach API
const url = 'https://api.datamuse.com/words';
const queryParams = '?sl=';
//queryParams will be the start of your query string and will narrow your search to words that sounds like your word.

// Selects page elements
const inputField = document.querySelector('#input');
const submit = document.querySelector('#submit');
const responseField = document.querySelector('#responseField');

// AJAX function
const getSuggestions = () => {
  const wordQuery = inputField.value;
  const endpoint = `${url}${queryParams}${wordQuery}`;
  
  fetch(endpoint).then(response => {
    if (response.ok) {
      return response.json();
    }
    throw new Error('Request failed!');
  }, networkError => {
    console.log(networkError.message);
  }).then(jsonResponse => {
    renderResponse(jsonResponse);
  });
}

// Clears previous results and display results to webpage
const displaySuggestions = (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  while(responseField.firstChild){
    responseField.removeChild(responseField.firstChild);
  }
  getSuggestions();
};

submit.addEventListener('click', displaySuggestions);
```

## Important!

``` javascript
fetch(endpoint).then(response => {
    if (response.ok) {
      return response.json();
    }
    throw new Error('Request failed!');
  }, networkError => {
    console.log(networkError.message);
  });
```

Thats essentially what it is :slightly_smiling_face: `JSON` stands for Javascript Object Notation, so its literally one big object of keys and values. The key will always be string but the value can be a string, number, array or even another object. Its also how a lot of API’s will return data so it will be the developers job to go through that JSON object and extract the values they want by accessing them via their keys.

When you make a request, the data response is going to contain a Header and a Body. `.json()` will take Response Body and format the incoming stream which is just a stream of data bytes to something that is human readable, `JSON`. The Content-Type which is also include in the Request Body will tell you what kind of data is coming in. Usually this will be `application/json`.
